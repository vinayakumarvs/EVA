#### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.

###### Some key terms that describe the basic elements of an RL problem are:
1.	Environment — Physical world in which the agent operates
2.	State — Current situation of the agent
3.	Reward — Feedback from the environment
4.	Policy — Method to map agent’s state to actions
5.	Value — Future reward that an agent would receive by taking an action in a particular state


Markov Decision Processes(MDPs) are mathematical frameworks to describe an environment in RL and almost all RL problems can be formulated using MDPs. An MDP consists of a set of finite environment states S, a set of possible actions A(s) in each state, a real valued reward function R(s) and a transition model P(s’, s | a). However, real world environments are more likely to lack any prior knowledge of environment dynamics. Model-free RL methods come handy in such cases.

Q-learning is a commonly used model-free approach which can be used for building a self-playing agent. It revolves around the notion of updating Q values which denotes value of performing action a in state s. The following value update rule is the core of the Q-learning algorithm.

#### What are some of the most used Reinforcement Learning algorithms?

Q-learning and SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) are two commonly used model-free RL algorithms. They differ in terms of their exploration strategies while their exploitation strategies are similar. While Q-learning is an off-policy method in which the agent learns the value based on action a* derived from the another policy, SARSA is an on-policy method where it learns the value based on its current action a derived from its current policy. These two methods are simple to implement but lack generality as they do not have the ability to estimates values for unseen states.

This can be overcome by more advanced algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks(DQNs) which use Neural Networks to estimate Q-values. But DQNs can only handle discrete, low-dimensional action spaces.

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG) is a model-free, off-policy, actor-critic algorithm that tackles this problem by learning policies in high dimensional, continuous action spaces. The figure below is a representation of actor-critic architecture.

###### Let’s understand the T3D step by step :

##### ***1.*** Initialize the Experience Replay Memory, with a fixed size (i.e. 1000000 in this exercise). We will populate it with each new transition

An experience (aka transition) is defined by the following:

    a. s: current state of an agent
    b. a: agent’s next action to go to next state
    c. s': new state of an agent reaches after taking an action (a)
    d. r: reward an agent receive for going from state (s) to state (s') by taking action (a)

Agent playing in an environment randomly and the experience of these movements stored in replay buffer memory. While training these batch of experiences sampled to train an agent. The memory is being replaced with the new experiences and deletes the old one to accommodate in a specified memory.

We will define a sample function as below, during training this becomes our dataset. Here we randomly sample a batch of experiences and use that as model inputs and for loss calculations.

``` python
    def sample(self, batch_size):
        ind = np.random.randint(0, len(self.storage), batch_size)
        batch_states, batch_next_states, batch_actions, batch_rewards, \
                batch_dones = [], [], [], [], []
        for i in ind:
            state, next_state, action, reward, done = self.storage[i]
            batch_states.append(np.array(state, copy = False))
            batch_next_states.append(np.array(next_state, copy = False))
            batch_actions.append(np.array(action, copy = False))
            batch_rewards.append(np.array(reward, copy = False))
            batch_dones.append(np.array(done, copy = False))
        return np.array(batch_states), np.array(batch_next_states), \
                np.array(batch_actions), np.array(batch_rewards).reshape(-1, 1), \
                np.array(batch_dones).reshape(-1, 1)
```
##### ***2.*** Build one neural network for the Actor model and one for the Actor target

The Actor target is initialized the same as the Actor model, and the weights will be updated over the iterations return optimal actions.
build two neural networks for the Critic models and two for the Critic targets.

##### ***3.*** Build two neural networks for the Critic models and two for the Critic targets.

In total, we have 2 Actor neural networks and 4 Critic neural networks.
The Actors are learning the Policy, and the Critics are learning the Q-values.
Here's an overview of the training process of these neural networks:

Actor target -> Critic target -> Critic target -> Critic model -> Critic model -> Actor model

We start by building the Actor targets, which outputs the Actions for the Critic target, which leads to the Critic model, and finally, the Actor model gets its weights updated through gradient ascent.
### We will look in to train the Model
##### ***4.*** We will perform the necessary actions in this step.
    1. Selecting the GPU or CPU
    2. Build the complete training process in to class. This will perform 
        a. Consider State dimensions, action dimensions and max action to perform Gradient decent, Polyak Average and optimiser

In each training iteration, as and when we sample batch of experiences from replay memory, our agent needs to take an action during that iteration. This is part of online training. The action which agent takes is selected by calling select_action. Agent's current state is passed to Actor model to get next action. This way agent is getting trained as well simultaneously performing action.

##### ***5.*** sample a batch of transitions (s, s', a, r) from memory.

In the implementation, we're going to use 100 batches with random sampling from the replay buffer memory. The following steps will be done to each transition from the batch (s, s', a, r).

Note: An environment also provides done variable to alert if an episode is done or not.

##### ***6.*** From the next state s' the Actor target plays the next action a'
An actor network predicts next action for an agent to take from current state. This is the step agent performs in an environment and is visible on the game/environment screen. The resulting state and reward is all stored as a new experience in the replay memory. This step is just to proceed the agent in the game/environment and to add entry in the replay memory.

##### ***7.*** Add Guassian noise to the next action a' and put the values in a range of values supported by an environment.

This is to avoid two large actions played from disturbing the state of the environment. The Gaussian noise we're adding is an example of a technique for exploration of the environment. We're adding bias into the action in order to allow the agent to explore different actions.

We will follow the Critic Training order as below in the coming stages:

##### ***8.*** The two Critic targets each takes the couple (s', a') as input and returns two Q-values: Qt1(s′,a′) and Qt2(s′,a′)

##### ***9.*** keep the minimum of the Q-values: min(Qt1,Qt2) - this is the approximated value of the next state.

    * Taking the minimum of the two Q-value estimates prevents overly optimistic estimates of the value state, as this was one of the issues with the classic Actor-Critic method.
    * This allows us to stabilize the optimization of the Q-learning training process.

##### ***10.*** we use min(Qt1,Qt2) to get the final target of the two Critic models:

The formula for this is Qt=r+γ∗(min(Qt1,Qt2)), where γ is the discount factor and r is reward

##### ***11.*** The two Critic models take the couple (s, a) as input and return two Q-values as ouptuts.

We now compare the minimum Critic target and compare it to the two Q-values from the Critic models: Q1(s,a) and Q2(s,a)

##### ***12.*** Compute the loss between the two Critic models

The Critic Loss is the sum of the two losses: 
CriticLoss=MSELoss(Q1(s,a),Qt)+MSELoss(Q2(s,a),Qt)

##### ***13.*** Backpropagate the Critic loss and update the Critic models parameters.
