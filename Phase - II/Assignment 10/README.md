## Twin Delayed DDPG - Reinforcement Learning

#### Objective

- Using T3D
- NOT using SENSORS
- Using Conv Network (very very simple one) on your sand (so you can use MNIST type too) to get the sensory data. 



- ai.py: T3D Model
- map.py: Car Environment
- car.ky: Kivy envoronment configuration
- images: Images of Map, Mask, Food and Destination
- pytorch_models: model weights
