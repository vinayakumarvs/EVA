# Deep Learning for Text

***1.*** Perform One-hot encoding of words and characters

    a. Word level one-hot encoding (toy example): Without Using Keras
    
    b. Character level one-hot encoding (toy example) Without Using Keras
    
    c. Using Keras for word-level one-hot encoding:
    
    d. Word-level one-hot encoding with hashing trick (toy example):
    
***2.*** Using word Embedding

    a. On Keras builtid IMDB data which is Pre Tokenised
    
    b. On Non Tokenised IMDB Data and Tokensize using the GloVe Embeddings
    
    Results are:
